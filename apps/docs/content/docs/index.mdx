description: What is BProgress?
---

**BProgress** (for Bar Progress) is built on the foundation of **NProgress**, a widely used progress bar library. However, **NProgress hasn't been maintained for over five years**, and its JavaScript codebase is outdated. Over time, many developers have submitted **issues and pull requests** requesting new features and improvements, but these have remained unaddressed.

The name **BProgress** stands for **"Bar Progress"**, reflecting its purpose while allowing for future improvements and a more flexible evolution of the library.

**BProgress is a modern reimplementation of NProgress**, fully rewritten in **TypeScript** with a clean and optimized syntax. It retains the simplicity of NProgress while introducing **modern best practices, active maintenance, and new features** that were missing from the original library. These improvements include **better customization, enhanced performance, and additional options requested by the community**.

Our goal with BProgress is to **make progress bars easy to integrate across multiple frameworks**. We're building dedicated packages to ensure **seamless, efficient, and flexible** progress bar integration, no matter what framework you're using. ðŸš€

## Why is BProgress useful?

**BProgress** is a lightweight progress bar designed to visually indicate loading states in web applications. It is commonly used to display a **smooth, animated progress bar** during **page transitions, data loading, or asynchronous operations**.

It helps users understand that a new page or content is being loaded, making navigation more intuitive and preventing confusion during transitions.
